NOTE: This project is unfinished because of some hardware issue that causes my PC to black out every time Tensorflow is initialized.

The bot is trained on the LeelaChessZero exploration dataset (a set of several million chess games generated by another AI), and uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search as playout. As of the time training was halted, it played at about the level of 8-year-old me; that is, not every well. This was still a fairly instructive project.

Side note: don't use Python when making a chess bot! The speed/complexity tradeoff just isn't good enough when you want your bot to take less than 30 minutes to make a move.
